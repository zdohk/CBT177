Hi Sam,

Good to hear from you.

These where indeed designed to provide xa/esa/zarch support to
ifox00, such that standalone test programs could be written for
zarch.  Please note that some rx instructions are not fully
implemented, and give a warning mnote.  The mnemac source is
generated from the hercules source code, please let me know if
you know how to improve upon these macros.

Jan
