//***FILE 177 is from Jan Jaeger, and contains an IEBUPDTE-unloaded *   FILE 177
//*           library of macros, which simulate XA, ESA, OS/390,    *   FILE 177
//*           and z/OS (64-bit) instructions.  The intent of this   *   FILE 177
//*           library is to be able to assemble newer code on an    *   FILE 177
//*           older version of the Assembler, even perhaps on       *   FILE 177
//*           IFOX00.  The macro library is member MNEMAC, and the  *   FILE 177
//*           job to produce the pds, is called $PDSLOAD.  Jan      *   FILE 177
//*           Jaeger's original JCL, saved intact, is member        *   FILE 177
//*           MNEMACO.                                              *   FILE 177
//*                                                                 *   FILE 177
//*           The original version of this file came from the       *   FILE 177
//*           FILES section of hercules-390@yahoogroups.com .       *   FILE 177
//*                                                                 *   FILE 177
//*           The older macros which had been on this file, came    *   FILE 177
//*           from a Western software house and consisted of some   *   FILE 177
//*           assembler macros which allow the old XF IFOX00        *   FILE 177
//*           Assembler to assemble XA code.  We are keeping that   *   FILE 177
//*           original member here also, as member OPCODES.  The    *   FILE 177
//*           reason for keeping that old member, is because it     *   FILE 177
//*           did things differently than Jan Jaeger does, and in   *   FILE 177
//*           my opinion, it is instructive to see the differences. *   FILE 177
